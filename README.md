# Neural Network Implementation with Numpy

This repository contains a simple neural network implementation from scratch using the NumPy library. The neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.

## Requirements
- NumPy
- Keras (for loading the MNIST dataset)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy keras
```
## Dataset
 The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is a commonly used dataset for machine learning tasks.
