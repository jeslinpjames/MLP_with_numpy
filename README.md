# Neural Network Implementation with Numpy

This repository contains a simple neural network implementation from scratch using the NumPy library. The framingham_classifier.py is trained on the Framingham Heart Study dataset for binary classification and the mnist_model.py is trained on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.

## Requirements
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
